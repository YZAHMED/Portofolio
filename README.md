02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio


I have created a responsive portofolio that adapts to different screen sizes.
This website has place holders for my projects. Also, the placeholder have view area from where my projects are linked.
The place holders wrap when screensizes change.
The button and links throughout are connected to different parts of the website.
